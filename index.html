		There is something nerve-wracking about publishing subpar code; code that is without a doubt not optimized, not finished, not necessarily advanced.<br><br><br>
		1. My website is a treehouse, is a metaphor I decided to use to talk about this type of code. Spaces that point to something larger but remain small.<br><br><br>
		2. Up, hardly connected, hardly accessible, unless invited. But here I hold a ladder out to you. Waits, patiently and without a mission. There is nothing to buy, to say, here. We can play, silently. Not much to do. Actions, up here, limited. Maybe we can listen to the leaves, the birds. Entire days in the trees. Everything, built from pieces of wood, bricks and code I found different places, barely holding together. Hard coded. Crafty, kind of, warmer this way. Do It Yourself construction. Else; a floating fort, with all the scraps of paper and pens to draw with. Else; a backyard shed built in the space of a few days and the indefinite tools inside. Personal, to some extent, a bit lonely, without company. 
		Most importantly, nothing required from its visitors.<br><br><br>
		3. Once, I found a site that had been built a long time ago. In ruins, bits missing, but somehow still standing amongst the new 
		sites all shiny all clean, all hyperefficient, fixed and all and all.<br><br><br>
		4. Publish all the sketches even if they are not finished. Ultimately, about in-efficiency, or some 
		kind of slowness I like. I find it very hard to code, but I like it. 5. I wondered what craft looks like on the web. High-resolution, responsive collages? Or what these spaces actually feel like. These scalable vector graphics I stretch across the screen, like colorful rubber bands, the weight, and gravity of
		a scratch. Pointing to the future. Promises. <br><br><br>
		6. Versus: the digital public infrastructures, sterile, colder. Labor, maintenance, all of it, invisible. Moving towards weightlessness, ease, and another kind of comfort, this one heterotopic. Domain names that were just claimed for some money. Like real land, a finite amount, belongs to someone, just data space, just data space? <br><br><br>
		7. Try to humanize something free of error.<br><br>
